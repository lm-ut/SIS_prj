# SIS_prj

### This script was used in the SIS_prj, now submitted  

The script will estimate allele frequencies on population Y based on the alleles available in population X.

### Usage: python script.py popX_file popY_file  

Where popX_file is the suffix of .frq plink file obtained from the reference population  
While popY_file is the suffix of .frq and .tped plink files obtained from the population on which we wanted to estimaed the allele frequencies, limited on the alleles shared with popX/reference population.
